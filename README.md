basic klingon language logic shown by basic CPU framework logic

give some words to klingon:

play what  
at home  
why  
cards  

klingon gives you sentences:

what don't you play at home  
why aren't you at home  
you are at home  
what don't you think you play  
what you play is not cards  
do you play cards at home  
you do play cards at home  
you play cards at home  
you play what you didn't play  
cards you play  
cards that you play  

klingon shows how our brains actually think to form sentences.
